# iTransformer

The repo is the official implementation for the paper: [iTransformer: Inverted Transformers Are Effective for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06625). [[Slides]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/175ff98f7e2d44fbbe8e/), [[Poster]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/36a2ae6c132d44c0bd8c/).

# Basic Info
Please see [iTrnasformer Main Link](https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer)

## Overall Architecture

iTransformer regards **independent time series as variate tokens** to **capture multivariate correlations by attention** and **utilize layernorm and feed-forward networks to learn series representations**.

The pseudo-code of iTransformer is as simple as the following:

## Usage 

1. Install Pytorch and necessary dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. The datasets can be obtained from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l51QsKvQPcqILT3DwfjCgx8Dsg2rpjot/view?usp=drive_link) or [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/2ea5ca3d621e4e5ba36a/).

2. Train and evaluate the model. We provide all the above tasks under the folder ./scripts/. You can reproduce the results as the following examples:

```
# Multivariate forecasting with iTransformer
bash ./scripts/multivariate_forecasting/Traffic/iTransformer.sh

# Compare the performance of Transformer and iTransformer
bash ./scripts/boost_performance/Weather/iTransformer.sh

# Train the model with partial variates, and generalize on the unseen variates
bash ./scripts/variate_generalization/ECL/iTransformer.sh

# Test the performance on the enlarged lookback window
bash ./scripts/increasing_lookback/Traffic/iTransformer.sh

# Utilize FlashAttention for acceleration
bash ./scripts/efficient_attentions/iFlashTransformer.sh
```

## How To Use
The hyperparameter settings are stated in run.py.

For using script, please use scripts.



## Main Result of Multivariate Forecasting

## General Performance Boosting on Transformers

By introducing the proposed framework, Transformer and its variants achieve **significant performance improvement**, demonstrating the **generality of the iTransformer approach** and **benefiting from efficient attention mechanisms**.

## Zero-shot Generalization on Variates

**Technically, iTransformer is able to forecast with arbitrary numbers of variables**. We train iTransformers on partial variates and forecast unseen variates with good generalizability.

## Better Utilization of Lookback Windows

While previous Transformers do not benefit from the enlarged lookback window. iTransformers show a surprising **improvement with the increasing length of the lookback window**.

## Model Analysis

Benefiting from inverted Transformer modules: 

- (Left) Inverted Transformers learn **better time series representations** (more similar [CKA](https://github.com/jayroxis/CKA-similarity)) favored by forecasting.
- (Right) The inverted self-attention module learns **interpretable multivariate correlations**.

- Visualization of the variates from Market and the learned multivariate correlations. Each variate represents the monitored interface values of an application, and the applications can be further grouped into refined categories.

## Model Abalations

iTransformer that utilizes attention on variate dimensions and feed-forward on temporal dimension generally achieves the best performance. However, the performance of vanilla Transformer (the third row) performs the worst among these designs, **indicating the disaccord of responsibility when the conventional architecture is adopted**.

## Model Efficiency

We propose a training strategy for high-dimensional time series. While the performance (Left) remains stable on partially trained variates of each batch with the sampled ratios, the memory footprint (Right) of the training process can be cut off significantly.
